PathToFile
==========

Sublime Text 2 plugin. Select a path, press the magic keybinding and it opens the file, or create the file.

The magic keybinding is:
* `ctrl+n` for Windows/Linux and
* `super+n` for OSX

Note: an empty selection opens a new window, like the original `super+n` or `ctrl+n` keybinding did.  
Note: works also for ST3
